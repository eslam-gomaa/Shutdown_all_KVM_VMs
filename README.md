# Shutdown All KVM VM's

A Simple Ruby script to shutdown All running **KVM Virtual Machines**



## WHY ?



When restarting a KVM Hypervisor which has running VM's, KVM will run a script to shutdown all the running VM's and will wait for standard time (110 Seconds) even if the VM's took much less time

**This Script does that same with saving our time**

## Usage

```bash
ruby shutdown_all_vms.rb
```
